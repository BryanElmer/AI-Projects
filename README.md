## Finding a Valid Path using Search Algorithms To Solve King's Maze Problem

Every instance of the chess board consists of obstacles, and enemy pieces that cannot be moved or captured. The goal of this problem is to move the king piece from a start position to any goal positions.

## The Four Search Algorithms used:
- **BFS**: Searches for a valid path from start position to goal position. The algorithm outputs the required moves, and number of nodes explored.
- **DFS**: Searches for a valid path from start position to goal position. The algorithm outputs the required moves, and number of nodes explored.
- **UCS**: Searches for a valid, optimal path from start position to goal position. The algorithm outputs the required moves, number of nodes explored, and the total path cost.
- **AStar**: Searches for a valid, optimal path from start position to goal position. The algorithm outputs the required moves, number of nodes explored, and the total path cost.
